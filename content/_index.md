## About

Welcome to the **Quantum Theory and Operator Theory satellite conference (QTOT)** of the **[International Congress of Basic Science](http://www.icbs.cn/)**,
taking place in the beautiful city of **Beijing** from **July 10th to 14th, 2023**.
This emerging event brings together leading experts and researchers from diverse backgrounds, fostering the exchange of innovative ideas, breakthroughs, and research findings in the areas of quantum and operator theories. As two of the most fundamental pillars of modern physics and mathematics, this interdisciplinary conference provides an unparalleled opportunity to explore their intersections, applications, and impact on our understanding of the universe.

Quantum theory, the cornerstone of modern physics, has revolutionized our comprehension of the atomic and subatomic worlds. It describes the strange and counterintuitive behavior of particles at the quantum scale, explaining phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and wave-particle duality. Operator theory, on the other hand, is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of linear operators on function spaces. It has played a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics, as well as various other fields such as functional analysis, differential equations, and mathematical physics.

The conference will feature a diverse array of presentations, panel discussions, and workshops led by esteemed experts from around the globe. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with the latest research findings, theoretical advancements, and computational methods in quantum theory and operator theory, as well as their applications in other disciplines. The event promises to spark stimulating conversations and collaborations that will propel our understanding of these complex subjects to new heights.

Apart from the academic program, the conference will also provide ample opportunities for networking and socializing. Set against the backdrop of Beijing, a city with a rich history and vibrant culture, attendees can explore iconic landmarks such as the Great Wall of China, the Forbidden City, and the Temple of Heaven, as well as immerse themselves in local arts, cuisine, and traditions. The conference organizers have meticulously planned a series of guided tours, cultural events, and receptions to ensure that participants have a memorable and enriching experience while in the city.

In summary, the International Conference on Quantum Theory and Operator Theory promises to be a landmark event in the fields of physics and mathematics. We warmly invite you to join us in Beijing and contribute your expertise to this exciting intellectual journey. Together, we will push the boundaries of knowledge and foster new connections that will shape the future of quantum and operator theories for years to come.
